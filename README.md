# Data Analyst Portfolio Project
Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio, where I showcase my projects in financial reporting, IFRS analysis, and business analytics. With experience in PL/SQL, Python, and Excel, I focus on extracting insights from financial data, optimizing queries, and building reports that drive decision-making.

PL/SQL Queries: Efficient data extraction and transformation for financial reporting.
Python Analytics: Data visualization and automation for financial insights.
